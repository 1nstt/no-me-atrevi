# README for the Backend Project

## Overview
This is a backend project built with Express.js. It serves as the server-side application for handling requests and managing data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables. An example of required variables might include:
```
DATABASE_URL=<your-database-url>
API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

## Running the Application
To start the application, run:
```
npm start
```

The server will start on the specified port (default is usually 3000).

## Project Structure
- `src/app.js`: Entry point of the application.
- `src/controllers/index.js`: Contains the IndexController for handling routes.
- `src/routes/index.js`: Sets up the application's routes.
- `src/models/index.js`: Defines data models.
- `src/middleware/index.js`: Contains middleware functions.

## Usage
Once the server is running, you can access the API endpoints defined in the routes. Use tools like Postman or curl to test the endpoints.
